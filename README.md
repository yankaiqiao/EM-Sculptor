# EM-Sculptor
EM sculptor is a novel electromagnetic design tool that integrates electromagnetics with computer graphics techniques. It supports low-scattering and pattern-specific electromagnetic optimization tasks for three-dimensional mesh structures.

We provide monostatic RCS measurement data of the calf model in the H-plane before and after optimization under compact range conditions, together with the initial mesh files of the sphere, aircraft, bunny, and calf models used in the experiments.
