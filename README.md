# EM-Sculptor
EM sculptor is a novel electromagnetic design tool that integrates electromagnetics with computer graphics techniques. It supports low-scattering and pattern-specific electromagnetic optimization tasks for three-dimensional mesh structures.

The code and data files will be uploaded later...
